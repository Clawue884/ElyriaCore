# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

Our platform is built using a microservices architecture, with multiple services communicating with each other to provide a seamless user experience.

## Services

### User Service

* Responsible for managing user data and authentication
* Provides APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users
* Uses a relational database to store user data

### Product Service

* Responsible for managing product data and inventory
* Provides APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting products
* Uses a NoSQL database to store product data

### Order Service

* Responsible for managing order data and processing payments
* Provides APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting orders
* Uses a relational database to store order data

## Communication

* Services communicate with each other using RESTful APIs
* APIs are designed to be easy to use and understand, with clear and concise documentation
* Services use a message queue to communicate with each other asynchronously

## Deployment

* Services are deployed using a containerization platform (e.g. Docker)
* Services are deployed to a cloud platform (e.g. AWS)
* Services are monitored and managed using a monitoring platform (e.g. Prometheus)
